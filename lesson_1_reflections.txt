How did viewing a DIFF between two verions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Command 'diff' let's you compare two files and see what's different. I ran the command without any parameters, which showed only the differences, which helped to find the bug quickly. A useful parameter is -u which shows all lines and flags the differences.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because Git is designed for programming projects which involve multiple connected files. Usually, when we make a change in one of the files it affects other files.
